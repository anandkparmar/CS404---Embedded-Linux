1)
Debian always has at least three releases in active maintenance: "stable", "testing" and "unstable".

stable

    The "stable" distribution contains the latest officially released distribution of Debian.

    This is the production release of Debian, the one which we primarily recommend using.

    The current "stable" distribution of Debian is version 8, codenamed jessie. It was initially released as version 8 on April 25th, 2015 and its latest update, version 8.2, was released on September 5th, 2015.

testing

    The "testing" distribution contains packages that haven't been accepted into a "stable" release yet, but they are in the queue for that. The main advantage of using this distribution is that it has more recent versions of software.

    See the Debian FAQ for more information on what is "testing" and how it becomes "stable".

    The current "testing" distribution is stretch.

unstable

    The "unstable" distribution is where active development of Debian occurs. Generally, this distribution is run by developers and those who like to live on the edge.

    The "unstable" distribution is called sid.
